[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chadkraus87/FullStackGroup2)

[Heroku Application](https://spots-1fbfc8155a67.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

The "Spots" application was created to provide users with a location that they are able to log in to a personal account and save the name and address of their favorite spots to visit. Users are also able to save a brief description of the spot, while uploading a photo if they choose to. The application allows users to view the spot on Google Maps.

This project was designed to help boot camp students learn how to work together as a group. The project helps students understand how to work with GitHub in creating new branches, creating pull and merge requests, and deleting branches. Students are applying what they have learned about Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, are using Handlebars.js as the template engine, and are using MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database. Students are also learning about new material which has not been discussed in class, which for our group, includes 

While completing this project we learned about building back end servers with a fully functional front end and database included. We were able to successfully implement a server and database that is live on Heroku. The application allows users to upload images, is user friendly, has an exciting UI, allows for ease of use and access, and has intuitive functionality. While completing this project we pushed beyond the MVP and made a product that is simple on the front end but has a dynamic back end.
